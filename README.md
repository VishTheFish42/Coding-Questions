# Coding Questions
A compilation of various coding problems I have come across and their solutions (in Python). Each problem will be continually updated with better solutions as I figure them out.
Below is a list of the problem descriptions tackled thus far, split by topic

## Arrays and Strings
1.  IS ANAGRAM: Given two strings, return whether or not the two are anagrams of one another.
2.  IS SUBSET: Given two strings, determine whether the second string can be created using ONLY letters in the first string.

## Math and Logic Puzzles
1.  IS PRIME: Given an integer, return whether the number is prime.
