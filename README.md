# Coding Questions
A compilation of various coding problems I have come across and their solutions (in Python). Each problem will be continually updated with better solutions as I figure them out.
Below is a list of the problem descriptions tackled thus far, split by topic

## Arrays and Strings
1.  IS ANAGRAM: Given two strings, return whether or not the two are anagrams of one another.
2.  IS SUBSET: Given two strings, determine whether the second string can be created using ONLY letters in the first string.
3.  NEIGHBORING ELEMENTS: Given a two-dimensional array and the position of an element (rows and columns start with 1), return the values of all neighboring elements.

## Math and Logic Puzzles
1.  IS PRIME: Given an integer, return whether the number is prime.
2.  REVERSE INTEGER: Given an integer, return the reversed form of that integer. No casting is allowed. If the initial number is negative, maintain the negative in the final answer (e.g. -123 becomes -321).

## Recursion and Dynamic Programming
1.  MAXIMUM SUBARRAY: Given an array of integers, return the starting index and ending index of the subarray that has the largest sum.
